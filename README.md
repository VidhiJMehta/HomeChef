## Inspiration
Sometimes we all just find ourselves bored with food from the same few fast-food places. We all miss the warmth you get from eating homemade food. Obviously, it is hard to integrate home cooking into our busy schedule every day.               With so many new apps supporting delivery and ordering from fast-food chains, we realized that home cooks like us were at a disadvantage due to a **lack of access and communication.** This website aims to bridge that gap by providing an easy way to buy **healthy homemade food** from the comfort of your home while supporting local home chefs.
